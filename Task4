//at this point I started thinking about Wolfenstein 3D and how John Romero created the maps of Wolf3d based on mazes and labyrithns., 
//and there are some proven ways to escape mazes 
//one is the Hand On Wall rule, left hand in this case, as we will make the carn turn left in any conjuction until eventually reaching AtGoal cell
//solution similar to Task2, but Task4 the car will always turn left
