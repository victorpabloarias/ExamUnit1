// here we will tell the car to drive straight until facing a wall, as in Task1. but there is a small change
//if facing wall, turn left of right depending on the availability of the cells to both right and left.
//however, every time there are two empty cells adjacent to both left and right of the one empty cell that is ahead of the car, then turn left.
// for instance, the car starts at cells 15-15, adn the AtGoal cells is at 3-16
//when at 12-9, facing upwards, then turn left. when at 11-8 facing left, then turn left. at 7-11, turn left. at 4-15, turn left to AtGoal
